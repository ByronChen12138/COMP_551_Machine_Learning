# COMP 551 Project 1 (Fall 2021)

## Acknowledgements

This repository is for **COMP 551** at **McGill University** for **Fall 2021**. Thanks to Byron Chen, Kevin Li, and Kaiwen Xu, without whom this project cannot be accomplished.

## Description
In this project we investigate the performance of two classification models, **KNN** and **Decision Trees** on two datasets, ie. Adult, Bank. We find that choosing a good hyper-parameter and feeding more data can result in better accuracy. In addition, we explore how dropping a feature from dataset can improve the performance.
