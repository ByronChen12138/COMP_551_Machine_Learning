# COMP 551 Machine Learning Fall 2021
Applied Machine Learning coursework at McGill University.

## **Project 1** - Introduction
In this project we investigate the performance of two classification models, KNN and Decision Trees on two datasets, ie. Adult, Bank. We find that choosing a good hyper-parameter and feeding more data can result in better accuracy. In addition, we explore how dropping a feature from dataset can improve the performance.

## **Project 2** - Optimization and Text Classification
In this project, we examine the effects of various modifications to the Gradient Descent optimizer; more specifically, we wish to experiment with mini-batches and momentum. The model we use is Logistic Regression. Then, we apply our knowledge in text classification, i.e., to classify fake news.

## **Project 3** - Multi-label Classification of Image Data
This classifier uses a convolutional neural network to perform classification on a modified version of the MNIST dataset. Pre-processing techniques and CNN structure are varied for optimal performance.

## **Project 4** - Paper Reproduction of CNN for Sentence Classification
This is a reproduction of part of the results in the paper: "A Bregman Learning Framework for Sparse Neural Networks" written by Leon Bungert, Tim Roith, Daniel Tenbrinck and Martin Burger.
